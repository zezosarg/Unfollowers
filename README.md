# Unfollowers
A simple python script that detects users who have stopped following you on instagram

To use, create the files followers.txt, following.txt and then copy and paste their contents from your instagram profile.

Future plans:

  Collect followers and followees using scraping with selenium as instagram api does not support this.

  Convert to a web app using flask.
